        <p>
          I am 34 year old software engineer with 8 years of remote working experience.
          Ever since my early school days I was in love with algorithms. My passion is
          not only to write code but also to write it efficiently and to optimise it in
          CPU and memory usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my career I learned that being remote working engineer does not only mean
          being a good programer. For past five years I worked closely with designers to
          design and develop a beautiful user experiences but also with product teams to
          create sustainable product roadmaps. Beside implementing new features and fixing bugs I
          also participated in code reviews with peers and managers to ensure that each increment
          adheres to original vision as described in the user story. When working in the company I
          am strongly motivated to understand the business side, our users, their requirements, and to
          deliver results. I have passion for continued learning and sharing my knowledge to others.
          I love to pick up new technologies and skills but I also enjoy sharing them in form of mentoring
          less experienced team members.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to architectural, product, design or process decisions I collaborate with strong
          judgement and an attention to details. When discussing new capabilities, my first instinct is to
          think of the user story rather than the feature set. I think in terms of making the most common
          interactions effortless, rather than making anything possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very independent, adaptable and self-directed. In my day to day work I require no other person
          for identifying things to work on and am capable of solving my own problems. I think of myself as
          a intelligent and fast learning person. Even though I tend to strongly stick to ideas that I think are good,
          I learned that getting wedded to ideas is not always best way to go. I also learned to throw prototypes
          away when something isnâ€™t working or isn't showing expected results. I Care about writing clean,
          well-documented code and appreciate static typing. I also care about browser performance and 
          like to use my knowledge in algorithms to ensure things are fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to join a team with established strong engineering culture. I am comfortable working with
          cross-functional and cross-cultural team and I belive that bringing my experience and knowledge of
          best practices can contribute to its growth. I am used to work remotely and my happiness at work
          comes from human relationships, growth opportunities, and a team mindset.
